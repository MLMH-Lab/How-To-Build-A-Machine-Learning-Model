The first thing we need to do is import the pandas library. To make the code simpler, it is common to import it as pd. This way, we simply type \"pd\" everytime we want to call the pandas library. From pandas, we use the function read_csv() to load the csv file containing our data. This will transform the data into an object called dataframe.\n",

Removing less relevant features will speed up the training process and may even improve prediction.\n",

In this example, we will use the popular recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. In principle, this is how RFE works:\n",

For simplicity, we will keep these hyperparameters with their default values: step = 1 and n_features_to_select = half of the features = 85.   \n",

This should be done via an additional CV inside the already defined CV, thus creating a nested CV where different values of C are fitted to the training set and tested in the validation set; the value of C with best performance is then used to fit the model to the training set as defined by the outer CV (see Chapter 2 for more details).\n",
